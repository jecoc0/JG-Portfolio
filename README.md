# Personal Portfolio: Week 2 Challenge

# Description

This project was completed to showcase the coding skills that I have developed thus far, and will be updated as I learn new things. i wanted to build a personal portfolio that showed a glimse of my HTML and CSS skills, but also contain a repository of existing projects that show other skills that I have developed, such as JavaScript.
This portfolio will provide any future employers with an idea of who I am personally and the level of work I am capable of creating.
While creating this project, I learned how to translate CSS from old projects to make it work in a new project. This was especially complicated when building out the flex capabilities in CSS.
